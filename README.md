# telegram-ocr-bot

Nice and simple ocr bot for telegram. Built just because I didn't wanna install another app on my phone.

The repository contains the source code to reproduce the bot. Select the python interpreter from /env to run the scripts, as all dependencies are provided in the virtual environment. However, a bot token is needed to make it work - Get a token from BotFather on telegram, and use it in line 12 in bot.py.
