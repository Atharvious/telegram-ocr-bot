I am your personal little scanner, that extracts text from the images you send me.

Commands:
OCR: just send me a picture, and I'll send you the text in it!

Text Summarization: /summary - Enter the desired text after the command.

I just want you to striaghten the image for more accurate extraction (you can do this in the telegram app itself, just before sending).

No data is handled/stored by any 3rd party service. It's only present in the telegram servers, as if you sent it to yourself.

As of now, only english language is supported.
